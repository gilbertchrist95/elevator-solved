The most optimum decision code for elevator inteligence (so far).

You can find original problem [here](https://github.com/shendykurnia/elevator)

## Pseudocode
1. If there are people inside, get the nearest destination floor from people inside and direction that most people inside wanted is TOP priority
2. If not, pick the nearest request
3. While delivering people, pick a request from the same floor with destination
4. While idle, set elevator stay on the middle of building
